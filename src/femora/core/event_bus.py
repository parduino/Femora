    These enum values describe *when* a callback is being invoked. They are
    not ordinary modeling commands. Instead, they mark important stages in the
    runtime lifecycle so advanced components can react at the right time.

    The most important practical events are:

    - `PRE_ASSEMBLE`: emitted before the final assembled mesh is built
    - `POST_ASSEMBLE`: emitted after the final assembled mesh exists
    - `RESOLVE_CORE_CONFLICTS`: emitted after assembly when partition/core
      ownership updates may need follow-up work
    - `PRE_EXPORT` and `POST_EXPORT`: emitted around export-time workflows

    More specialized events such as `EMBEDDED_BEAM_SOLID_TCL` are used by
    advanced exporters and interface-specific integrations.

    to one another.
