# Workflow execution

Stages run in order. A parallel stage starts its tasks concurrently and waits
for all of them before continuing. A failed stage prevents subsequent stages;
the other already-running tasks are allowed to finish. Logs and the manifest
remain available after failure.

## Local execution

`tiny_opensees.py` builds two serial Femora cantilevers and compares their
displacements. `local_parallel_stages.py` demonstrates Python callbacks.
Local execution remains the default; it does not launch MPI ranks.

## TACC execution inside an allocation

The TACC backend runs within an existing Slurm compute allocation. It does not
authenticate, submit a Tapis job, allocate nodes, install packages, or download
results. Machine/queue/allocation selection stays outside the workflow.

```python
fm.execute(workflow, workspace="results", backend=fm.jobs.backends.TACC())
```

Or replay a trusted bundle:

```bash
python -m femora.jobs replay workflow.zip --workspace results --backend tacc
```

The backend uses `SLURM_NTASKS` as its rank-slot budget (not the machine's CPU
count). `--cores` can reduce that budget but cannot enlarge it. Each external
task launches as `ibrun -n RANKS -o OFFSET task_affinity PROGRAM ...`.
Parallel stages assign contiguous, non-overlapping hostlist offsets; subsequent
stages reuse slots only after the preceding stage completes. This follows
[TACC's concurrent MPI guidance](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/hpc/3stampede/launching/).

An OpenSees task declares `ranks=N`. A generic MPI program, including a Python
script using mpi4py, uses:

```python
fm.tasks.Command("mpi-python", ["python", "/shared/path/program.py"],
                 cores=3, ranks=3)
```

Relative command arguments resolve from the task's output directory, not the
workflow source directory. All nodes must see the workspace and software.

Initial limits:

- One CPU per rank; hybrid/threaded task layouts are rejected. External tasks
  receive single-thread settings for OpenMP, MKL, and OpenBLAS.
- Python callbacks run on the coordinator, in sequential stages with `cores=1`.
  Parallel callbacks and mixed callback/MPI parallel stages are rejected.
- Capacity covers CPU rank slots, not memory. The caller must request enough RAM.
- TACC defaults to `OpenSeesMP`, including for one rank; local execution defaults
  to `OpenSees`. A task's `executable`, then `FEMORA_OPENSEES`, override the default.
  There is no fallback to a serial binary if `OpenSeesMP` is missing.
- OpenSees tasks source the original Tcl file through a generated error-catching
  driver. Tcl errors emit `FEMORA_JOB|ERROR|` and request a nonzero exit; the runner
  checks that marker even if the launcher returns zero. TACC also checks `getNP`
  before sourcing the model. Failed stages block later stages once running tasks
  finish; this is not MPI-wide immediate cancellation or deadlock recovery.
- An unchecked nonzero return from Tcl `analyze` is not a Tcl exception. Models
  must check it and raise `error` (Femora's analysis exporter does this).
- Bundles contain executable Python: run only trusted inputs under the submitting
  user's permissions, never a privileged shared service account.

## Stampede3 smoke test

Request an allocation from the login node (add `-A YOUR_ALLOCATION` if needed):

```bash
idev -p skx -N 1 -n 5 -m 20
```

On the compute node:

```bash
module load python/3.12.11
module use /work2/08189/amnp95/modules
module load femora opensees/3.8.0
export FEMORA_OPENSEES="$(command -v OpenSeesMP)"
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
RUN_DIR=$(mktemp -d "$SCRATCH/femora-mpi.XXXXXX")
cd "$RUN_DIR"
python /work2/08189/amnp95/stampede3/femora-tapis/Femora/examples/workflows/tacc_mpi_smoke.py --bundle mpi.zip
python -m femora.jobs replay mpi.zip --workspace results --backend tacc --cores 5
cat results/compare/summary/comparison.txt
```

Expected: `single`, `pair_a`, and `pair_b` report 2, 2, and 3 ranks respectively,
each with displacement `0.001`. The parallel pair uses offsets 0 and 2.
This deliberately tiny test solves an independent spring on each rank. It
validates MPI launching and result collection, not a coupled partitioned Femora
model or parallel solver. A coupled-model test is still required before using
this for large distributed simulations.

The opt-in integration test (requires pytest) runs inside the same allocation:

```bash
FEMORA_TEST_TACC_MPI=1 python -m pytest /path/to/Femora/tests/jobs/test_tacc.py \
    -k real_tacc_bundle --basetemp "$RUN_DIR/pytest-tmp"
```

Use a new `--basetemp` directory: pytest clears it. Unit tests mock the TACC
launcher and are not evidence of a successful cluster run.

## Submit from the same file

With an already registered Femora Tapis app, the MPI example now supports the
public API directly from your local terminal:

```powershell
python examples/workflows/tacc_mpi_smoke.py --submit --app-id amnp95-femora-workflow-stampede3 --allocation DesignSafe-SimCenter
```

These identifiers are for the current pilot; other users must select their own
allocation and an accessible app. The command asks for confirmation and a private
DesignSafe login, validates the `skx-dev` request, packages its own top-level
`build_workflow` function, uploads to a unique user input directory, and submits
one job. No manual ZIP creation or job JSON is needed. Default resources are the
explicit SKX pilot settings (one node, 48 cores, 20 minutes), not a universal TACC
default. Use `--queue` and `--cores-per-node` to select another exposed queue.

Record the UUID. Existing `deploy/tapis/manage.py status` and `download` commands
can monitor this job, or authenticate again and use `TACCPlatform.job(uuid)`.
Do not rerun `--submit` just to check progress. The `--bundle` mode remains available.
See `src/femora/jobs/platforms/README.md` for the platform-independent interface,
factory packaging restrictions, and job-handle methods.
