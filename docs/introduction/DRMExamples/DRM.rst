    <h1>Introduction</h1>

The Domain Reduction Method (DRM) is a powerful technique for modeling seismic wave propagation in a computationally efficient manner. This section provides a series of examples demonstrating how to use FEMORA's DRM capabilities to model increasingly complex scenarios.

    <h2>Key Concepts of Domain Reduction Method</h2>


The Domain Reduction Method, first proposed by Bielak et al. (2003), is a two-step approach for modeling wave propagation problems:

1. **Background Analysis**: A large-scale analysis (often simplified) to capture regional wave propagation from source to site.
2. **Local Analysis**: A detailed analysis of a smaller domain of interest, using the results from step 1 as boundary conditions.

This approach offers several advantages:

* **Computational Efficiency**: Focuses computational resources on the domain of interest
* **Realistic Wave Input**: Captures complex wave patterns without modeling the entire source-to-site path
* **Flexibility**: Works with various wave types, source mechanisms, and site conditions
* **Enhanced Resolution**: Allows for detailed analysis of local site effects and structure-soil interaction
