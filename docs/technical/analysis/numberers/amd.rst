AMD Numberer
============

The Approximate Minimum Degree (AMD) numberer implements the AMD algorithm to minimize fill-in during matrix factorization by optimizing the equation numbering scheme.

Description
-----------

The AMD numberer:
- Uses graph theory to minimize matrix fill-in during factorization
- Reorders DOFs to reduce computational cost
- Particularly effective for sparse matrices
- Implemented as a singleton to ensure consistent numbering across the model

Parameters
----------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
   * - None
     - 
     - This numberer doesn't take any parameters

Usage Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   # Create a Femora instance
    

   # Get an AMD numberer
   fm.analysis.numberer.get_numberer("AMD")

Notes
-----

- Optimizes matrix structure to minimize fill-in during factorization
- Particularly effective for irregular mesh patterns
- Can significantly reduce memory requirements and computational cost
- May require more setup time than Plain numberer
- Recommended for large-scale problems with irregular patterns
- Especially beneficial when using sparse direct solvers
