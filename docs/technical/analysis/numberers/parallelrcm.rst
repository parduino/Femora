Parallel RCM Numberer
=====================

The Parallel Reverse Cuthill-McKee (Parallel RCM) numberer is a parallelized version of the RCM algorithm that provides improved performance for large-scale problems while still reducing matrix bandwidth.

Description
-----------

The Parallel RCM numberer:
- Uses a parallel implementation of the RCM algorithm
- Distributes the reordering computation across multiple processors
- Reduces setup time for large problems
- Maintains the bandwidth reduction benefits of RCM
- Implemented as a singleton to ensure consistent numbering across the model

Parameters
----------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
   * - None
     - 
     - This numberer doesn't take any parameters

Usage Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   # Create a Femora instance
    

   # Get a Parallel RCM numberer
   fm.analysis.numberer.get_numberer("ParallelRCM")

Notes
-----

- Combines the benefits of RCM with parallel processing
- Particularly effective for very large problems
- Can significantly reduce setup time compared to serial RCM
- Requires parallel processing capabilities
- Recommended for large-scale problems on multi-core systems
- Maintains the same quality of bandwidth reduction as serial RCM
