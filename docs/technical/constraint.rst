Constraints
===========

Femora provides a comprehensive constraint system to apply boundary conditions and enforce specific behaviors in your model. This documentation covers the different types of constraints available in Femora.

The constraint system includes two main categories:

1. **SP Constraints**: Single-point constraints that fix or control degrees of freedom at specific nodes
2. **MP Constraints**: Multi-point constraints that create relationships between multiple nodes
